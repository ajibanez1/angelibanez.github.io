            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Angel Ibanez from Providence, Rhode Island. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island, majoring in Computer Science. 
                I am passionate about coding and excited about building software that solves real-world problems.

            <h2>What is a Software Developer and why I want to be one?</h2>
            <p>
                A Software Developer is a person that creates, tests, and maintains software, programs, systems, and etc.
                all software developers use different kind of programs such as Python,javascript, C++ and a lot more. these programs
                specialize for tons of different type of applications and problems a software developer. <br>
                My reasoning for wanting to be a software developer is because ever since I was a kid, I loved technology and especially computers. 
                Another reason is because my 2 brother work in the field of software developering and they are really big inspirations for me.

            <h2>How I Plan to Achieve My Goal</h2>
            <p>
                My journey to becoming a software developer involves actively working on projects and mastering key computer science concepts.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solo Projects:</strong> I focus on creating real-world projects to develop practical skills and problem-solving abilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Group Projects:</strong> Collaborating with others allows me to gain experience in teamwork and understand the challenges of coding as a group.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> A deep understanding of data structures is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code, and it is a major area of my focus.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Artifact 1: Solo Projects</h2>
            <p>
                As I said before, solo projects are one of the biggest way to get into the software developer field.
                there is a multiple of projects you can do with code from small to big.<br>
                This website in itself a project for me. I created this with 2 programming languages call html and css.
                these to languages are the heart of creating and designing a website.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML:</strong> In short, HTML is basically a markup language, so all 
                        you‚Äôre really doing is setting up what you want on your website, like headers, text, sections, and so on. There‚Äôs no complex functionality,
                         just laying out the structure of the website. It‚Äôs one of the main ways people create portfolios to show off their coding skills. </li>
                    <li><strong>CSS:</strong>While HTML is just setting up the website, CSS is doing all of the magic in designing the website.
                    CSS controls the styling and design of a website. so if you want to change the background color, font, or the way the text is setup, you use css to help you with that.
                    both of these languages can help you with showing the interviewer what type of person you are.</li>
                </ul>
                There is a lot more things you can add to a website like javascript, which is another coding language, that add so much more like a whole interactive aspect to this website but I am not to familiar with it just yet
                ,but I plan of studying the language so I can upgrade my websites.

            <h2>Artifact 2: Group Projects</h2>
            <P>
                Group projects are a great way to show that your are able to work on a team. Doing a couple of big projects with some my friends that also want to go in the same field as me
                can really help us in the long run and show interviewers that I can contribute to a team environment which is very important in my field
                <h2><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/final-flappy-bird/5364661677637632">Final Flappy bird</a></h2><script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/final-flappy-bird/5364661677637632/embed.js?editor=no&buttons=no&author=no&embed=yes"></script>
                This is my first group project. It is a flappy bird remake with an angry bird. This was my final for my first comp sci class. This project was make with the help of my classmate. I mainly worked the design of the whole thing like the bird and the pipe. I also helped with the jumping part.
                This project help me with communicating and being on the same pace with another person.

            <h2>Artifact 3: Data Stuctures and LeetCode</h2>
            <p>
                Data structures are one of the toughest but most important parts of programming, and they‚Äôre a big focus in coding interviews. They‚Äôre essential building blocks for organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently. Different structures, like Linked Lists, Queues, and Trees, each have their own uses depending on the problem.

                <br>Getting a strong handle on data structures can make a huge difference, especially when practicing on LeetCode. So many LeetCode problems cover exactly what comes up in coding interviews, making it a great way to build my problem-solving skills. Right now, I‚Äôm taking a data structures class, and once I‚Äôve got the basics down, I plan to dive into LeetCode. My goal is to land an internship early in college so I can start building experience that looks good on my resume.
